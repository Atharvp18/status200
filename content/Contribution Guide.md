# ðŸŒ± **Status 200 Contribution Guide**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Status 200**! Your contributions will help this digital garden grow and become an even more valuable resource for tech enthusiasts worldwide. Follow the steps below to get started.

## ðŸš€ **How to Contribute?**

To contribute, all you need to do is clone the repository, install Quartz, and start adding your files to the content folder. Here's a detailed guide:

### 1. **Fork the Repository**

Before cloning, you need to fork the **Status 200** repository to your own GitHub account.

1. Go to the [Status 200 repository](https://github.com/sarthakchandajkar/status200).
2. Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### 2. **Clone Your Forked Repository**

Now, clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/status-200.git
```

### 3. **Create a New Branch**

To avoid making changes directly to the `v4` branch, create a new branch for your contributions:

```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Replace `your-branch-name` with a descriptive name related to your contribution.
### 4. **Install Quartz Locally**

Quartz is the tool we use to build and host this digital garden. Follow the steps below to install it:

1. **Navigate to the repository:**

```
cd status-200
```

2. **Install Quartz:**

```
npm i
```


For more detailed instructions on installing Quartz, visit the official [Quartz Documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz).

### 5. **Open the Cloned Folder as a Vault in Obsidian**

To add content efficiently, open the cloned repository folder as a vault in Obsidian:

1. Open Obsidian.
2. Select **Open Folder as Vault**.
3. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository (`status-200`) and select it.

Now, you can directly create, edit, and organize your notes in Obsidian.

### 6. **Add Your Content**

Once Quartz is installed, you can start adding your notes, roadmaps, study materials, or personal experiences. Add your content inside the `content` folder of the repository. 

```
cd content
```

You can organize your content into subfolders for different topics, such as:

`- content/`   
`- software-development/`     
`- ai-ml/`     
`- data-science/`  
`- solutions-architecture/`

Feel free to use Markdown for your notes, and make sure to link related topics using relative paths like:


```
[Learn more about AI/ML](../ai-ml/intro.md)
```

### 7. **Create Backlinks to Connect Ideas**

To make **Status 200** more interconnected and easy to navigate, we strongly encourage you to create backlinks between related ideas and topics. This enhances the gardenâ€™s utility by allowing users to seamlessly explore connected concepts.

In Obsidian, you can create backlinks by enclosing the name of another note in double square brackets:

```
[[Data Structures]]
```

Use these links generously to connect ideas, build a web of knowledge, and create a richer learning experience for everyone!
### 8. **Commit and Push Your Changes**

Once youâ€™re happy with your additions, commit and push your changes:

```
git add . 
git commit -m "Added new content on AI/ML" 
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 9. **Create a Pull Request**

After pushing your changes to your forked repository:

1. Go to your fork on GitHub.
2. Click **Compare & pull request**.
3. Write a brief description of the changes you made and submit the pull request.

Weâ€™ll review it, and once approved, your content will be merged into the main repository!

### 10. **Keep Exploring and Contributing**

Remember, the garden is constantly evolving. Keep contributing as you learn and grow, and encourage others to do the same!
